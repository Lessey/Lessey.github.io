    My owner is Ana Strgar. We live with our family in Slovenia. We enjoy long walks and drinks with friends. She often takes me with her on a hike into the mountains. I love snow. I guess she does too, since she also takes me with her when she goes skiing. Snow is just the best thing ever! Besides from the water of course. Oh, and balls and sticks and practically anything that you can go and fetch. Twice a week she takes me to this place, where I can jump over obstacles and go through tunnels and over the swings. I like that. I also like when we go to this other place where she has to walk besides me and we do turns and all kind of other stuff, which I have to do alone. Like sit and lay down or go on the table. It sometimes makes my brains hurt, but I love it nevertheless.

    Back to my owner. She likes mounting climbing. When we are at home she reads a lot.

    Oh, and I also have this other owner, who is more like my mom, because she spoils me a lot. That is Anaâ€™s mom, Katja. She is also the one, who says I should have a lot of lady friends and go to this event, where there is a lot of other dogs. And they all go in circles with their handles. She gives me this delicious yellow stuff (I think it's called cheese) right from the big white wardrobe. Sometimes Ana catches her and she goes mad at her mom. Like really mad. But I don't care. I got the snack!

    And there is another human, who takes care of me. I think he is like a mate of Ana's. He doesn't spoil me. But he takes me for a walk and we play a lot. Every time he visits I just know, something exciting is going to happen! A hike to the mountains. A week at the seaside! A new toy!

    I just love my humans!
